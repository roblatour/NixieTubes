# NixieTubes

This open source (MIT) library can be used to draw Nixie Tubes on a TFT display using Arduino code.

It has been tested with a LilyGo T-Display S3.

An example demo program is included; the code is well commented and walks you through the features of the library.

An example open sourece Nixie Tube Clock (Arduino code) program will be available seperately on GitHub soon.

Additioanlly included, in the extras folder of this library, is the vb.net program used to generates the tubes (i.e. the image files and there associcated header file update code)

The tube image is also in the public domain, and was created by my dear wife.

The font used inside the Nixie Tubes is Roboto, which is open source too: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto

The tube images can be updated (using the above mentioned vb.net program) to be other sizes, display other fonts, use different font, mesh and background colours, etc..
