# NixieTubes

This open source (MIT) library by Rob Latour can be used to draw Nixie Tubes on a TFT display using Arduino code.

# Example programs

An example demo program is included with the library; the code is well commented and walks you through the features of the library.

Additionally, an example open sourece Nixie Tube Clock (Arduino code) program is also available seperately at https://github.com/roblatour/NixieTubeClock

# Creating your own Tube screens

Additioanlly included, in the extras folder of this library, is the vb.net program used to generates the tube screens (i.e. the image files and there associcated header file update code)
This program can be used to taylor for other sizes, fonts, a different mesh, colours, etc..

The tube image is also in the public domain, and was created by my dear wife.

The font used inside the Nixie Tubes is Roboto, which is open source too: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto

This program has been tested with a LilyGo T-Display S3.
